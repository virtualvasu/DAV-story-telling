            <h2>1. The Spark: Why Track UPI Transactions?</h2>
            <p>As a data enthusiast, I often find myself exploring numbers in my everyday life. This time, I turned my
                attention to my UPI transactions. We make digital payments almost unconsciously‚Äîwhether it's a quick
                coffee, groceries, or an impulsive online order. But what if I took a step back and analyzed my spending
                patterns? Could I uncover habits I wasn't even aware of?</p>
            <p>So, I decided to collect my UPI transaction data for three months and visualize it.</p>

                <h3>How Much Do I Usually Spend? </h3>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>I started by plotting a histogram of transaction amounts. This gave me a clear picture of how
                            my payments are distributed‚Äîare they mostly small daily expenses, or do large purchases
                            dominate?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The majority of my transactions fell in the <b>small to mid-range category</b>, meaning
                                I tend
                                to make frequent low-value payments rather than occasional high-value ones.</li>
                            <li>A few outliers represented expensive purchases, which stood out from my usual spending
                                habits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This initial insight set the stage for deeper analysis.</p>

                <h3>Big Spender or Small Purchases? </h3>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>To get a clearer sense of how often I make small versus large payments, I created a pie chart
                            dividing transactions into two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Small transactions (< ‚Çπ200)</li>
                            <li>Large transactions (‚â• ‚Çπ200)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Surprisingly, a significant portion of my payments <b>(96%)</b> were small transactions,
                            likely for daily
                            expenses like snacks and stuff. However, the large transactions, though less frequent,
                            contributed significantly to my total spend.</p>

                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Next, I wanted to see how my spending fluctuated across the month. A line graph plotting
                            daily transactions helped me visualize spending peaks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some days saw a spike in spending‚Äîprobably due to paying bills, weekend outings, or
                                online shopping.</li>
                            <li>On other days, my spending was minimal, reflecting no major expenses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Looking at these fluctuations helped me identify high-expenditure days and potential areas
                            where I could cut down.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>To make my visualization even more insightful, I created a scatter plot where each dot
                            represented a transaction, and its size was proportional to the amount spent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The scatter plot vividly displayed clusters of small payments and occasional large
                                spikes.</li>
                            <li>It reinforced the idea that while smaller transactions are frequent, the larger ones
                                make up a significant portion of total spending.</li>

                        <p>To wrap up, I looked at how much I spent on each weekday using a bar chart.</p>
                        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Sunday</b> saw the highest spending followed by <b>Monday</b>, likely due to I stock
                                all my snacks for
                                the week.</li>
                            <li>Midweek payments were relatively lower, with most transactions happening on Monday and
                                Sunday‚Äîprobably routine payments like groceries or online orders.</li>
                            <li>Slight spending peak on <b>Thursday</b>, with most transactions happening on Monday and
                                Sunday‚Äîprobably due to snacks running out, I spend again to refil them.</li>
